# rotateLeft Function

The `rotateLeft.js` file contains a function named `rotateLeft` that takes two parameters as input: an array of integer numbers as the first parameter and another integer number as the second parameter. The second parameter indicates how many times the elements of the array will be left-rotated.

## How to Run
* Clone the repository to your machine and navigate to this directory.
* Install `Node.js` on your machine if it is not already installed.
* Open the `rotateLeft.js` file using `VS Code` or any other code editor of your choice.
* Specify the input of your choice for the `rotateLeft` function. The default array is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` and the default number of rotations is `2`.
* Save the changes and run the command `node rotateLeft.js` to run the code and see the output in the terminal for the array before and after rotation.
